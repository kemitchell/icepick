## Purpose
This is a weapon of mass user protection.

There are many ways to protect individual's control over the software they rely on.  These terms leverage the power vested in software creators by intellectual property law to demand transparency, accountability, and independence for those who depend on the creators' work.

Through these terms, the creators of this software surrender the greater part of their power.  They make this software free for everyone to use, study, change, build on, and share.

They retain their power, and wield it through these terms, only to stop others misusing this software to deny you transparency, accountability, or control.  They invite and empower you to defend your rights for yourself.

## Agreement

In order to receive any license under these terms, you must agree to their rules.  Those rules are both obligations under an agreement among developers, providers, and users of this software, and conditions to all your licenses under these terms.  You must not do anything with this software that triggers a rule you cannot or will not follow.

## Rights
The purpose of these rights is to ensure you and others the same level of control you would enjoy running the software for yourselves.  In using this software, you must respect these rights of others, as they must respect these rights of yours.

### Framework
Control over software run by others must follow three principles:

- _Transparency_:  You must be able to tell if others are running this software for you as you would run it for yourself.

- _Accountability_:  Those who mislead you must face consequences.

- _Independence_:  If you decide that others aren't running this software for you as you would for yourself, you must be able to switch to running this software for yourself, or to having someone different do so for you.

Applying those principles leads to a number of practical requirements:

-  _Disclosure_:  You must have information about the storage, processing, and communication of your data, as well as the environment in which those occur.

-  _Completeness_:  You must have all information necessary to assess.

-  _Practicality_:  You must have that information in the preferred form for use.

-  _Permission_:  You must have all necessary permission to use that information.

-  _Noninterference_:  You must not be stopped receiving or using information you require.

Your user rights under these terms apply these requirements to each element of computing: [Software](#software), [Data](#data), [Processing](#processing), [Networking](#networking), and [Environment](#environment).  A [general rule against interference](#noninterference) applies to all.

### Noninterference

1.  Data they have provided to this software that it stores.

2.  Data the software has collected and stored about their use of this software.

3.  Data required, in addition to 1 and 2, for the user to provide the same functionality running the software for themself that you have provided running the software for them.

### Transparency

## Enforcement
Any contributor to this software, anyone with a license under these terms, and any user of this software or software services provided with it can enforce any rule of these terms by seeking orders to stop breaking its rules, orders to comply with its rules, and money compensation.

## Legality
Every rule of these terms is qualified by the law.  If following a rule of these terms absolutely would break the law, these terms only require you to follow the rule to the extent you can legally.  If any adjudicator of these terms decides that any rule is completely unenforceable in its jurisdiction, but enforcing the rest would not defeat the purpose of these terms, the rest of these terms will still apply.

If you do not do so, your participation in the agreement, and all your licenses under these terms, end immediately.

## Patent
Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe any patent claims they can license or become able to license, so long as you respect the [Rights](#rights) of others.
