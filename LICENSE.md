## Purpose
This is a weapon of mass user protection.

There are many ways to protect transparency and control for people who rely on software.  These terms leverage the power vested in software creators by intellectual property law.

Using these terms, the creators of this software surrender the greater part of their power.  They make this software free for everyone to use, study, change, build on, and share.

They retain their power, and wield it through these terms, only to stop others misusing this software to deny you transparency or control.  They invite and empower you to defend those rights for yourself.

## <a id="user-rights">User Rights</a>
These terms terms ensure you all the following rights, so long as you respect the same rights of others.

### Purpose
The purpose of these rights is to give you substantially the same transparency and control you would enjoy if you ran the software entirely for yourself.

### Principles
Your rights under these terms reflect four key principles:

1.  _Access_:  You must be given the materials used to store, process, and communicate your data.

2.  _Completeness_:  You must be given all the materials used.

3.  _Practicality_:  You must be given materials in the preferred form for using them.

4.  _Permission_:  You must be given all the necessary permission to use the materials yourself.

### Aspects
Your rights under these terms apply the four key principles to four key aspects:

1.  _Software_:  instructions for computers to store, process, and communicate your data

2.  _Data_:  data that you provide to the software, and data the software collects about your use 

3.  _Processing_:  the computer that runs the software on your data

4.  _Networking_:  the infrastructure that communicates software and data to others

## Acceptance
In order to receive any license under these terms, you must agree to their rules.  Those rules are both obligations under an agreement among developers, providers, and users of this software, and conditions to all your licenses under these terms.  You must not do anything with this software that triggers a rule you cannot or will not follow.

## Enforcement
Any contributor to this software, any recipient of a license under these terms, and any user of this software or software services provided with it can enforce any rule of this license.

## Legality
Every rule of these terms is qualified by the law.  If following a rule of these terms would be illegal, these terms do not require you to break the law.  If any adjudicator of these terms decides that any part is unenforceable, but enforcing the rest would not defeat the purpose of these terms, the rest of these terms will still apply.

## Copyright
Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe that contributor's copyright in it, so long as you respect the [User Rights](#user-rights) of others.

## Notices
You must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of any part of this software from you, with or without changes, also gets the text of this license or a link to <{url}>.

## Excuse
If anyone notifies you in writing that you have not complied with any of these terms, you can keep your licenses by taking all practical steps to comply within 30 days after the notice.  If you do not do so, your license ends immediately.

## Patent
Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe any patent claims they can license or become able to license, so long as you respect the [User Rights](#user-rights) of others.

## Reliability
No contributor can revoke any license under this compact.

## No Liability
***As far as the law allows, this software comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and no contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages related to this software or this license, under any kind of legal claim.  This rule does not apply to claims against contributors for breaking the rules of these terms.***
