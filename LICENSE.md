## Purpose
This is a weapon of mass user protection.

There are many ways to protect users' control over the software they rely on.  These terms leverage the power vested in software creators by intellectual property law to demand transparency, accountability, and independence for users.

Through these terms, the creators of this software surrender the greater part of their power.  They make this software free for everyone to use, study, change, build on, and share.

They retain their power, and wield it through these terms, only to stop others misusing this software to deny you control.  They invite and empower you to defend your right to control for yourself.

## <a id="user-rights">User Rights</a>
These terms terms ensure you all the following rights, so long as you respect the same rights of others.

### Purpose
The purpose of these rights is to ensure you the same level of control you would enjoy running the software for yourself.

### Framework
These rights serve their purpose by applying key principles:

- _Transparency_:  You must have the ability to tell if others are using the software for you as you would use it for yourself.

- _Accountability_:  Those who mislead you about how they use the software for you must face consequences.

- _Independence_:  You must have the means to use the software for yourself, or have someone else use it for you.

These terms apply those principles through a number of practical requirements:

-  _Disclosure_:  You must be given information about the storage, process, communication of your data, and the environment in which that occurs.

-  _Completeness_:  You must be given all necessary information.

-  _Practicality_:  You must be given information in the preferred form for use.

-  _Permission_:  You must be given all the necessary permission to use the information yourself.

-  _Noninterference_:  You must be allowed to do whatever you please with the information, within the law.

### Rules
Your user rights under these terms apply each of the techniques to each of the elements of computing: [Software](#software), [Data](#data), [Processing](#processing), [Networking](#networking), and [Environment](#environment).

## Acceptance
In order to receive any license under these terms, you must agree to their rules.  Those rules are both obligations under an agreement among developers, providers, and users of this software, and conditions to all your licenses under these terms.  You must not do anything with this software that triggers a rule you cannot or will not follow.

## Enforcement
Any contributor to this software, anyone with a license under these terms, and any user of this software or software services provided with it can enforce any rule of this license.

## Legality
Every rule of these terms is qualified by the law.  If following a rule of these terms would break the law, these terms do not require you to break the law.  If any adjudicator of these terms decides that any part is unenforceable, but enforcing the rest would not defeat the purpose of these terms, the rest of these terms will still apply.

Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe that contributor's copyright in it, so long as you respect the [User Rights](#user-rights) of others.

## Notices

## Excuse
If anyone notifies you in writing that you have broken any rule of these terms, you can remain a part of the agreement among developers, providers, and users, and keep your licenses under these terms, by taking all practical steps to comply within 30 days after the notice.  If you do not do so, your participation in the agreement, and all your licenses under these terms, end immediately.

## Patent
Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe any patent claims they can license or become able to license, so long as you respect the [User Rights](#user-rights) of others.

## Reliability
No contributor can revoke any license under these terms.

## No Liability
***As far as the law allows, this software comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and no contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages related to this software or these terms, under any kind of legal claim.  This rule does not apply to claims against contributors for breaking the rules of these terms.***
