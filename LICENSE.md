## Purpose
This is a weapon of mass user protection.

There are many ways to protect control for people who rely on software.  These terms leverage the power vested in software creators by intellectual property law to demand transparency and accountability for those they serve.

Using these terms, the creators of this software surrender the greater part of their power.  They make this software free for everyone to use, study, change, build on, and share.

They retain their power, and wield it through these terms, only to stop others misusing this software to deny you control.  They invite and empower you to defend those rights for yourself.

## <a id="user-rights">User Rights</a>
These terms terms ensure you all the following rights, so long as you respect the same rights of others.

### Purpose
The purpose of these rights is to ensure you the same level of control you would enjoy running the software for yourself.  They do so by ensuring you four fundamental protections:

1.  _Transparency_: the ability to tell if others are using the software for you as you would use it for yourself

2.  _Independence_: the means to use the software for yourself instead, if they do not

3.  _Accountability_: the ability to punish those who mislead you about how they use the software

### Principles
Your rights under these terms reflect four key principles:

1.  _Access_:  You must be given the materials used to store, process, and communicate your data.

2.  _Information_:  You must be given information about how those materials are used on your behalf.

3.  _Completeness_:  You must be given all the materials used.

4.  _Practicality_:  You must be given materials in the preferred form for using them.

5.  _Permission_:  You must be given all the necessary permission to use the materials yourself.

6. _Noninterference_:  You must be allowed to do whatever you please with the materials, within the law.

### Aspects
Your rights under these terms apply the five key principles to the four key elements of computing:

1.  _Software_:  instructions for computers to store, process, and communicate your data

2.  _Data_:  data that you provide to the software, and data the software collects about your use 

3.  _Processing_:  the computer that runs the software on your data

4.  _Networking_:  the infrastructure that communicates software and data to others

### Noninterference
User rights under these terms must be honored practically, not procedurally.  Using software, cryptography, or legal rights, such as anticircumvention laws, is not permitted.  Nor is assisting or facilitating others' violation of user rights.

## Acceptance
In order to receive any license under these terms, you must agree to their rules.  Those rules are both obligations under an agreement among developers, providers, and users of this software, and conditions to all your licenses under these terms.  You must not do anything with this software that triggers a rule you cannot or will not follow.

## Enforcement
Any contributor to this software, anyone with a license under these terms, and any user of this software or software services provided with it can enforce any rule of this license.

## Legality
Every rule of these terms is qualified by the law.  If following a rule of these terms would break the law, these terms do not require you to break the law.  If any adjudicator of these terms decides that any part is unenforceable, but enforcing the rest would not defeat the purpose of these terms, the rest of these terms will still apply.

## Copyright
Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe that contributor's copyright in it, so long as you respect the [User Rights](#user-rights) of others.

## Notices
You must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of any part of this software from you, with or without changes, also gets the text of this license or a link to <{url}>.

## Excuse
If anyone notifies you in writing that you have broken any rule of these terms, you can remain a part of the agreement among developers, providers, and users, and keep your licenses under these terms, by taking all practical steps to comply within 30 days after the notice.  If you do not do so, your participation in the agreement, and all your licenses under these terms, end immediately.

## Patent
Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe any patent claims they can license or become able to license, so long as you respect the [User Rights](#user-rights) of others.

## Reliability
No contributor can revoke any license under these terms.

## No Liability
***As far as the law allows, this software comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and no contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages related to this software or these terms, under any kind of legal claim.  This rule does not apply to claims against contributors for breaking the rules of these terms.***
