## Purpose

This is a weapon of mass user protection.

These terms leverage the power vested in software creators by intellectual property law to demand transparency, accountability, and independence for those depending on their work.

Through these terms, the creators of this software surrender the greater part of their power.  They make this software free for everyone to run, study, change, build on, and share.

They retain their power, and wield it through these terms, only to stop others misusing this software to deny you transparency, accountability, or control.  They invite and empower you to defend your rights and the rights of others.

## Agreement

In order to receive any license under these terms, you must agree to their rules.  Those rules are both obligations under an agreement among developers, distributors, and users of this software, and conditions to all your licenses under these terms.  You must not do anything with this software that triggers a rule you cannot or will not follow.

## Rights

These rights ensure you and others the same level of control you would enjoy running the software for yourselves when the software is run for you by others.  In using this software, you must respect these rights of others, as they must respect these rights of yours.

### Principles

When someone else runs this software for you, they must uphold three principles:

- _Transparency_:  You must be able to tell if they are running this software for you as you would run it for yourself.

- _Accountability_:  If they mislead you, they must face consequences.

- _Independence_:  If you decide that they aren't running this software for you as you would run it for yourself, you must be able to switch to running this software for yourself, or to having someone different run it for you, without reduction in quality of service.

### Requirements

Taken together, the principles impose a number of requirements:

-  _Disclosure_:  On request, you must be given information about the processing, storage, and transmission of your data, the environments in which that occurs, and the software used to accomplish it. <!-- the thing itself of sufficient information to procure it --> <!-- verify identity -->

-  _Completeness_:  You must have all information necessary to assess whether others are running this software for you as you would run it for yourself.

-  _Practicality_:  You must have that information in the most practical formats, such as those this software can process. <!-- must be able to get practical deal for, say, rented computer and network -->

-  _Permission_:  You must have all necessary permission to use that information.

### Elements

The principles and their requirements apply to every element of computing:

- _Software_:  all source code, tools, configuration, and other computer code used to run, study, change, build on, and share this software

- _Data_:  all data you provide to the software, data the software collects about you, and additional data the software uses to derive additional data or functionality from those data

- _Processing_:  all computer hardware, physical or virtual, used to run the software for you

- _Connectivity_:  all hardware, physical or virtual, and rights necessary to connect to software and data to communications networks

- _Jurisdiction_:  the legal environments governing the software, data, processing, and connectivity used to run the software for you

#### Processing

1.  What architecture, operating system, and other specifications would they need to procure a system to run this software as you have?

2.  What configuration would they need to configure such a system to run this software as you do?

#### Networking

1.  What are the network addresses of the systems you are using to process their data?

## Legality

The law qualifies every rule of these terms.  If following a rule absolutely would break the law, these terms only require you to follow the rule to the extent you can legally.  If any adjudicator of these terms decides that any rule is completely unenforceable in its jurisdiction, but enforcing the rest would not defeat the purpose of these terms, the rest of these terms will still apply.
